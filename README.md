# KickStart Selection Process Project

This project was created exclusively for the KickStart selection process. It demonstrates the use of Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that focuses on speed and performance.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kickstart-selection-project.git
   cd kickstart-selection-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

To build and start the project, use the following commands:

1. **Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and you can view the project at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Build for Production**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

   This will build the project for production in the `dist` directory.

3. **Preview the Production Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   # or
   yarn serve
   ```
   This will serve the production build locally to verify everything is working correctly.
